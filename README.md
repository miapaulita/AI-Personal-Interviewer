## Step 1: Install Python Libraries

Before running the application, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this by using the following command:

```bash
pip install assemblyai openai elevenlabs mpv portaudio
Required Libraries
assemblyai: For real-time speech-to-text transcription.
openai: For generating AI responses based on the transcribed text.
elevenlabs: For streaming audio responses to the user.
mpv: A media player for playing audio streams.
portaudio: A cross-platform audio I/O library.
Step 2: Real-Time Transcription with AssemblyAI
AssemblyAI performs real-time speech-to-text transcription. It listens to audio input and converts it into text, which can then be used for generating responses.

Step 3: Pass Real-Time Transcript to OpenAI
The transcribed text is then sent to OpenAI, which generates a response based on the user's input. This allows for interactive conversations with the AI.

Step 4: Live Audio Stream from ElevenLabs
Finally, the generated response is streamed as live audio to the user through ElevenLabs, providing a seamless auditory experience.
